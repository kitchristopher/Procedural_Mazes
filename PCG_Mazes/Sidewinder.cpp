/*Sidewinder Algorithm
Starting at the top left corner, run across each row, randomly link upwards or east. When linking upwards, the current grouping(run) of adjacent cells ends.
When the run ends, move into the next east tile without linking. Repeat the process until done.

Bias: The north corridor is always linked.
